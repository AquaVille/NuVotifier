# NuVotifier Fork - Bukkit only

This fork increases username length to 32 characters.
Build against latest release of Paper 1.21.4

NuVotifier is a secure alternative to using the original Votifier project.
NuVotifier will work in place of Votifier - any vote listener that supports
Votifier will also support NuVotifier.

NuVotifier supports many different platforms using the same universal JAR:

+ Bukkit / Spigot / Paper >=1.7.10

NuVotifier also adds forwarding and listener test commands not present in the
original version.
